Using the Drive API alone, all of a users Google Photos can be retrieved, with their metadata being sent to the application. The Maps API is then used to display this information on a map, with markers in their place.

### Current Features
- Shows photos on a map

### Upcoming
- Group photos into areas
    - Set marker icon to be cover of 'area' like apple photos
- Search for photos
    - Perhaps using objects, faces etc. as Drive API should cover this.
- Export as very high res map
- Allow tagging of photos at locations
- Add formatted location to image properties for easier retrieval.
